This file holds the dynamic field mapping templates for the "fsfd" ElasticSearch index. The mappings are compatible with the fields in the logstash pipeline for "fsfd", logstash/pipeline_examples/logstash_fsfd.conf.

Docs on ElasticSearch dynamic mapping: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/dynamic-mapping.html

Run the following in Kibana's console to create a new index with the name "fsfd". You must delete any existing index with the name "fsfd" prior to this.
